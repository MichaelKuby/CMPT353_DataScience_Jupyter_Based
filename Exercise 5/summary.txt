Hence, x's values are more spread out across a larger rangethan that of y's, whos values are comparatively more similar, and groupedaround its mean. Also note the positive correlation between x and y: whenwe see an increase in one, we expect an increase in the other, and vice versa.###############################################################################DataSet 2                x           ymean     0.968907    8.508535std      2.235558    1.149301min     -2.449064    6.641734max      4.518885   10.551871Correlational Coefficient for x and y of dataset 2 : 0.9819372646760661First note that variables x and y have non-overlapping values. Second, notefrom their min and max values that they both occupy fairly narrow ranges. In particular, that x spans about 7 values while y spans about 4 values. Third, note that relative to their ranges they both have somewhat similarsized standard deviations, with y's being slightly (smaller which seemsappropriate considering it has a smaller range). If we consider each of thesetogether we can say for certain that the y values are shifted to the right on the number line relative to x, and that the y values are slightly more constrained in their range and variability. Finally, note their strong positivecorrelation: when we see an increase in one, we expect an increase in the other, and vice versa. ###############################################################################DataSet 3                x           ymean    -0.710787   -0.748987std     11.481584    6.257918min    -33.271113  -18.621804max     27.647000   14.147315Correlational Coefficient for x and y of dataset 3 : 0.9551531665750373x and y have very similar mean values, but the range of x is considerablygreater. The greater range of x is accompanied by a greater std in x as well.Thus, x's values are generally more spread out than are y's, with fewervalues bunched around the mean. If we were to graph the bell curves of thesetwo data sets, we would see that x is flatter and more spread out, whiley is taller and more narrow. Finally, note that strong positive correlationbetween the two data sets from the r value. When we see an incease in one, we expect an increase in the other, and vice versa.###############################################################################DataSet 4                x           ymean     7.216155    7.602215std     11.921599   11.764382min    -24.333821  -22.956357max     35.402139   36.079874Correlational Coefficient for x and y of dataset 4 : 0.9350685662094905These data sets appear to be extremely similar. Each of their means, std,and min and max values are within only a few values of each other, and in the case of their means and std, within only a few tenths. It would not besurprising if these values were samples of the same value from the same population. Again we see a very strong positive correlation in the data, which based on the aforementioned analysis is not surprising. Changes in the x values will lead to similar changes in the y values.###############################################################################DataSet 5                x           ymean    49.909994   18.555525std     28.500001   16.540796min      4.337892    0.055498max     91.052863   49.934197Correlational Coefficient for x and y of dataset 5 : -0.08823598983058886First notice that x and y have relatively similar minimum values, but that xhas a maximum value ~2x that of y's. Thus we can say the range of x isconsiderably greater, and this increased range is in x's higher values. This larger range in values also skews x's mean quite a bit higher than y's.Finally, x's standard deviation is nearly double that of y, suggesting thatthe amount of variation in the data is actually somewhat comparable to y when we consider its larger range. We should also note the r value, which isvery near zero: this tell us that there is almost no correlation between thedata. That is, when we see a change in x, we can say almost nothing about how y will behave.###############################################################################DataSet 6                x           ymean    49.905086   18.553837std     28.508611   16.545896min      0.000000    0.000000max     87.376700   44.565040Correlational Coefficient for x and y of dataset 6 : -0.08119306735490815Looking at y we can see that it will have relatively little variation since itsmax and min values are only marginally outside one standard deviation from the mean. x is similar in this respect, as both its minimum and maximum valuesare within two standard deviations to either side of the mean. Contrasting themwe note that while they have identical minimum values, the range of x is nearlytwice that of y. In fact, the maximum value for y is actually lower than the average value for x. Their relative distributions, considering their differeingranges, however, are somewhat similar. Again we should also note the r value, which is very near zero, tells us that there is almost no correlation between the data. When we see a change in x, we can say almost nothing about how y will behave.###############################################################################
